1.One persistent bug I encoutered was my programming producing only
a limited amount of states. I solved this by modifying my actions function
also, I couldn't get a prune count but I solved this by creating a global static
varialbe.

2.I received help from myself and professor Kirlin.

3. One series problem I encountered was figuring out the Eval function.

4. I attempted to use the heuristic provided on the page.

5. I enjoyed this project.
